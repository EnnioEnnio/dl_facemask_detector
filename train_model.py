"""
TODO: train_model.py

This file is responsible for training your model using the training data.
It typically includes the training loop, which iterates over the training dataset, 
feeds the data through the model, computes the loss, performs backpropagation, 
and updates the model parameters using an optimizer.
It can also include code for monitoring and logging training progress, 
saving checkpoints of the model, and performing early stopping if necessary.
